# WhatsApp-Chat-Analysis-Tool
 A tiny python script that gets number of whatsapp messages sent in a chat alongside how many each person sent.

 ---------------------------------------

## How to use:
1) Export the chat from your phone and send the .txt file to your pc.
2) Place the file next to "main.py" and run the script.

## Results:
- "Rawchat elements" means the number of lines in the file.
- "Total messages sent" is the number of individual messages sent by both parties.
- "Number of exception messages" is the number of lines that were part of already existing messages.
